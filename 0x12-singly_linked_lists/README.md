# C Linked Lists Concepts

This directory contains a collection of code examples and explanations related to the fundamental concepts of linked lists in the C programming language. Linked lists are essential data structures that allow for dynamic and efficient storage of data. This repository provides a hands-on approach to understanding and working with linked lists in C.

## Introduction

In the "Introduction" section, you will find basic explanations and examples to help you get started with understanding linked lists, their advantages, and their use cases.

## Singly Linked Lists

The "Singly Linked Lists" section explores the implementation of singly linked lists. It covers how to create, traverse, insert, and delete nodes in a singly linked list. Code examples are provided to illustrate these concepts.

## Doubly Linked Lists

The "Doubly Linked Lists" section delves into doubly linked lists, a variation of linked lists that allows traversal in both directions. You'll learn how to implement doubly linked lists and perform common operations like insertion and deletion.

## Circular Linked Lists

The "Circular Linked Lists" section introduces circular linked lists, where the last node points back to the first node. This section explains their properties and demonstrates how to work with them.

## Common Operations

The "Common Operations" section provides code snippets and explanations for frequently used operations on linked lists, such as reversing a linked list, finding the middle element, and detecting loops.

## Advanced Topics

In the "Advanced Topics" section, you'll find more advanced concepts related to linked lists, including self-adjusting lists, skip lists, and practical use cases where linked lists excel.
